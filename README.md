# PredSleep
Project Name

Predicting Sleep Variables (TotalSleep and Dreaming) in Mammals

Prerequisites

Python 3.11 or higher.
See the requirements.txt file for detailed information on library versions.
Installation
Instructions on setting up the project locally, including any necessary environment setup and dependency installations.

Introduction

This project is situated within an academic context, focusing on the application of machine learning techniques to a dataset for predicting total sleep duration and dreaming time in mammals. One of the primary challenges is the dataset's limited size (87 rows) and the presence of significant missing data.

Dataset

The dataset, Sleep_merged.tsv, encompasses sleep attributes for 87 mammals, including general species characteristics, biological attributes, and ecological factors, alongside specific sleep attributes.

Features

General Attributes:

Species: Name of the species.
Order: Lower taxonomic rank.
Genus: Higher taxonomic rank.
Vore: Dietary pattern (carnivore, omnivore, herbivore).
Conservation: Conservation status according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.
Biological Attributes:

BodyWt: Body weight in kilograms.
BrainWt: Brain weight in grams.
LifeSpan: Maximum lifespan in years.
Gestation: Gestation time in days.
Ecological Attributes:

Predation: Predation index (1-5).
Exposure: Sleep exposure index (1-5).
Danger: Overall danger index (1-5).
Sleep Attributes:

TotalSleep: Total sleep time in hours per day.
Awake: Time spent awake in hours per day.
NonDreaming: Slow wave (non-dreaming) sleep in hours per day.
Dreaming: Paradoxical (dreaming) sleep in hours per day, detected by REM phase.

Usage

To utilize this project effectively, follow these steps:
Ensure Python 3.11 or higher is installed on your system.
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/AbedAdounkpe/PredSleep.git 
Navigate to the project directory: cd PredSleep
Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Execute the main script to start the prediction process.
Follow the interactive prompts or execute specific modules as needed for analysis.
